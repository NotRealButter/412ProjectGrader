/* 1 */ Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,  
/* 2 */ save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night,  
/* 3 */ was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and  
/* 4 */ picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night  
/* 5 */ before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the  
/* 6 */ sort which is known as a "Penang lawyer." Just under the head was  
/* 7 */ a broad silver band nearly an inch across. "To James Mortimer,  
/* 8 */ M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.," was engraved upon it,  
/* 9 */ with the date "1884." It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned  
/* 10 */ family practitioner used to carry -- dignified, solid, and reassuring.
